<h3>
My plan for everything I'm going to work on this week!
</h3>
<h4>
1. Create the HTML hacks page regarding a wireframe (which was given to us) of HTML elements on a page, and then create the actual HTMl code which goes in hand with the wireframe.
</h4>
<h4>
2. Work on changing stylistic elements in the snake game (part one of the requested snake assignment)!
</h4>
<h4>
3. Learn JavaScript to allow the player to choose whichever stylistic elements they want (part two of the snake assignment)!
</h4>
<h4>
4. Further my understanding of how JavaScript, HTML, and CSS work through this week's snake game!
