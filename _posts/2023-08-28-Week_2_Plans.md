<h3>
My plan for everything I'm going to work on this week!
</h3>
<h4>
1. Write a tangible about how I made my about me (Converting markdown text to HTML so that I can utilize CSS styling)
</h4>
<h4>
2. Create a fun Capture-The-Flag game and write a hack about how I made it (Utilizing Windows and Linux tools to make it)
</h4>
<h4>
3. Explain how to actually solve the Capture-The-Flag with my partner on a partner post (explain the history of each exploit and how to protect yourself from it)!
</h4>
<h4>
4. Clean up the repository and remove all of the default teacher repository posts and pages
