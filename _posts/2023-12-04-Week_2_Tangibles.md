All about how I learned basic Markdown to teach me HTML, which introduced me to CSS
</h3>


<h4>
For HTML, the first thing I had to do was learn how to use Markdown. 
<br>
Markdown is a very simple language that uses a couple of basic identifiers!
<br>
Some of these descriptors with examples are:
</h4>

# Header 1
<h4>
This is coded by writing: # Header 1
</h4>

## Header 2
<h4>
This is coded by writing: ## Header 2
</h4>

### Header 3
<h4>
This is coded by writing: ### Header 3
</h4>

**Bold**
<h4>
This is coded by writing: **Bold**
</h4>

*Italics*
<h4>
This is coded by writing: *Italics*
</h4>

> Block
<h4>
This is coded by writing: > Block
</h4>

`code`
<h4>
This is coded by writing: `code`
</h4>

<h4>
But what really did this help me learn? After all, it's just memorizing basic syntax right...?
<br>
Well for starters, the first thing I wanted to learn how to do is how to code those headers in HTML. And to me, this was a basic google search that showed this:
</h4>

<h4>
Header 1 is:
</h4>

`<h1> text here </h1>`

<h4>
Header 2 is:
</h4>

`<h2> text here </h2>`

<h4>
and so on!
<br>

<footer class="site-footer">
</footer>

But again, this is still very basic, and my thirst for cool graphics wasn't quenched just yet.
<br>
What I did next was a big step from just the default theme's colors, to setting my own!
<br>
<br>
In the style.scss, I found that defining a code called:
</h4>
`h1 {
}`
<h4>
and placing this cool gradient text in there:
</h4>
`background: linear-gradient( 
      to right, #a17100, #fff); 
    -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent; 
    -webkit-background-clip: text;`
<h4>
allowed me to have the amazing headers which I love now!
<br>
<br>
This was just a spark for many other things, such as adding gradients, changing text colors, and even the hardest thing for me, changing the color of the banner from an ugly swamp green and dark blue to a beautiful light blue and lavender!
